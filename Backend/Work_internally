1️) What happens when user hits API ?
- lets suppose in client section i clicking a button when i click the button the request goes on the server.in server we defined as 3 layer architecture.
  so the req comes in controller architecture(validate input,Calls service layer/business logic,Handles authentication/authorization) then service layer 
  executes(bussiness logic,Calling repository/database) then it interact with database(Fetch products,Save user data) and server prepare to responce in
  client(Status code (200, 201, 404, 500),Response body (usually JSON) )
  flow -> User → HTTP Request → Router → Controller → Service → Database → Response → UI

2) How frontend communicates with backend ?
- frontend communicate backend through http request(apis) lets breakdown
  1. User click the button.
  2. Req to send using http methods(get,post,put,delete) ex- this using fetch
  3. Data sent in request(Headers → auth token and content type, query parameter->filter , json formate
  4. Backend processes request (Receives request, Validates data, Executes logic, Interacts with database)
  5. Backend sends response (Status code (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, JSON data)

3) What is JSON ?
- JSON(JavaScript Object notation) is a lightweight data format used to store and exchnage data between frontend and backend.

4) What is http protocol ?
- http(hyper text transfer protocol) is a communication protocol used to send the data between client to server.

5) What are HTTP Status Codes?
- HTTP status codes are 3-digit numbers returned by the server to tell the client whether a request was successful or failed.
