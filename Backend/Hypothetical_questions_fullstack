1) Tell Me About Your Project Architecture ?
- my project a layered architecture with frontend,backend and database.
  the frontend is build using React,for styling i use tailwind css. the frontend(react) which handle UI and sends the Api request to backend.
  the backend is build using node js/spring boot. where controller handle requests, service contain business logic, and database layer manage 
  data persistence.
This separation makes the application scalable, maintainable, and easy to test.
