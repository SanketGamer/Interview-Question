1) Tell Me About Your Project Architecture ?
- my project a layered architecture with frontend,backend and database.
  the frontend is build using React,for styling i use tailwind css. the frontend(react) which handle UI and sends the Api request to backend.
  the backend is build using node js/spring boot. where controller handle requests, service contain business logic, and database layer manage 
  data persistence.
 This separation makes the application scalable, maintainable, and easy to test.

2) What APIs you created ?
- i have created Restfull Apis for CRUD operations like creating,fetching,updating and deleting. for example in my project i built apis for user authentication and managing products/courses.
  i used http methods like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE handled json data, and implemented proper status code and error handling.

3) How authentication works ?
- Authentication is a process of verifying a user identity. when users login they send credentials like email,password.the server verifies them from the database.
  and if valid they generate a tokens which used to authorize further requests.

4) Why we used jwt token ?
- hypothetically asume same name 100 people login so how the server know which one is the correct one because all are same name so they defined each have a indentity called token thats how we use token.
  Even if multiple users have the same name, When they log in, the server generates a unique JWT token containing their identity, so the server can identify exactly which user is making the request.

5) What challenges you faced when you doing a fullstack project ?
- while working on my fullstack project, i faced challenges like handling API intregation, managing state(data changes over the time) between frontend and backend, authentication implemetation, and debugging errors.
  i solve the using proper logging, testing Apis with Postman.

6) What error you faced mostly when u create a fuullstack webapp ?
- Mostly i faced issues like API responce errors, authentication token issues, CORS errors, and database connections problems. i solved them debugging logs,checking api responses in Postman, and
  verifying requests headers.

7) How you deployed a project ?
- i deployed my project in cloud based platform. i configuard envirement variables,connected database,and tested apis after deploy the frontend and backend to ensure evrything is correct.
